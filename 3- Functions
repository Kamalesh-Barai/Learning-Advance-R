# Function components
# All R functions have three parts:
# the body(), the code inside the function.
# the formals(), the list of arguments.
# the environment(), the map of the location of the function's variables.

f <- function(x) x^2
f

formals(f)
body(f)
environment(f)

# Primitive functions
# Primitive functions, like sum(), call C code directly with .primitive()
# and contain no R code. Therefore their formals(), body(), and
# environment() are all NULL:

sum
formals(sum)
body(sum)
environment(sum)

# What function allows me to tell if an object is a function?

# What functions allows me to tell if a function is a primitive function?
